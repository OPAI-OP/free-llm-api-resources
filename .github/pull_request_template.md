Before adding a new provider, there's a few general guidelines as to what providers would be accepted into the repo, primarily around trustworthiness and legitimacy:

1. Is the provider a legitimate company?
2. Does the provider provide a proper API service?
   For example, reverse engineering services such as Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Qwen Code, etc are not considered appropriate for this list.
3. Does the provider have a business model?
4. Does the provider provide legitimate services?
   For example, providing commercial models such as Anthropic or OpenAI models for free or at steep discounts can suggest questionable business practices, such as chatbot reverse engineering, API credit resale/theft, or other similar practices.

These guidelines are not exhaustive, but attempts to put into writing what sort of providers might be included in the list.
